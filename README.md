# Lucky Mandarin Trainer

A lightweight, Duolingo-style Chinese character trainer focused on festive vocabulary.

## Included starter vocabulary

恭, 喜, 發, 財, 新, 年, 快, 樂, 福, 紅, 包

## How to open the app

### Option 1 (recommended): run a local web server

```bash
cd /workspace/kelvin_vibecode
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open this URL in your browser:

- <http://localhost:4173>

### Option 2: open the file directly

Open `index.html` in your browser.

> Note: Some browsers restrict certain features when opened as a local file (`file://...`), so Option 1 is more reliable.
